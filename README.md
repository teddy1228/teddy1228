## 👋 Kia ora, I’m Teddy  

I’m a recent Master of Information Technology graduate from the University of Waikato, with three years of experience in international companies and one year of local experience in New Zealand. My background spans both technical and client-facing roles, giving me strong foundations in end-user support, cloud technologies, and software development.  

I enjoy breaking down problems, communicating clearly, and helping people get their systems working again. I bring a calm, can-do attitude to every task, and I’m now looking to grow my IT career in a dynamic team environment where I can continue learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and deliver excellent user support.

## 🧰 What I’ve Worked On

### 🖥️ IT Support & Technical Operations  
My foundation in IT comes from years of hands-on problem solving.  
At **Schneider Electric**, I supported enterprise clients with Level 1–2 UPS troubleshooting, resolving 400+ hotline cases and managing escalations through systems similar to ServiceNow. I learned how to communicate clearly, keep users calm, and work efficiently through ticket queues.

Through roles in engineering and environmental consulting, I worked with ERP systems, managed documentation, coordinated cross-department workflows, and supported real-world technical processes — experience that translates directly into service desk and IT operations environments.  

Today, I continue building on this foundation through Microsoft 365 support, Windows/macOS troubleshooting, networking essentials, and ITSM-style workflows.

## 💻 Web Development  
I began coding because I liked the idea of building tools that actually *do something* — from interfaces that help people learn, to systems that turn data into insight.

Technologies I use:  
**HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Vue.js · MySQL · Node.js · AWS · Docker**

### 🧪 Projects  
**Te Reo Māori Board Game – UI/UX + Front-End Prototype**  
- Designed user flows and interactive components in Figma  
- Built early front-end logic with HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Conducted usability testing and iterated based on real user feedback  
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

**Cloud-based Data Visualization Tool – AWS & Docker**  
- Built a web application that converts uploaded CSVs into interactive charts  
- Implemented a smooth cloud deployment pipeline with Docker + AWS  
- Focused on scalable execution and clean user experience  
:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

**Online Survey System – Full Stack (Vue · Spring Boot · MySQL)**  
- Developed survey creation, persistence, and analysis features  
- Built core logic for forms, accounts, and backend processing  
- Collaborated across UI, backend, and database layers  
:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

I enjoy projects that blend clarity, structure, and user experience — whether it's front-end behaviour, backend logic, or turning data into something people can understand.
